<p>With the potential to unlock millions of jobs and draw the gaze of international visitors to Nigeria, Keji Giwa and Daniel Agoye of Digital Landlords have launched ‘Affordable Escapism’, a compelling alternative, highlighting the allure of local resorts, amusement parks, and entertainment venues across the country.</p>



<p>At the heart of this movement is Giwa Gardens, one of the largest water parks in West Africa, a brainchild of Keji Giwa which offers a range of family-friendly attractions, including water houses, pirate ships, and a wave pool, catering to both domestic and international tourists. This establishment is a perfect example of promoting domestic tourism while appealing to a global audience.</p>



<p>Similarly, Lekki Party Villas, another innovative project by Giwa, targets adults seeking luxurious, private venues for social gatherings. These villas, featuring amenities like rooftop penthouses and jacuzzis are designed to align with the evolving economic and social needs of Nigerians.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>According to the founders of these tourism projects, the vision is to create places where luxury and leisure are accessible without the need for a foreign stamp on passports whilst creating memorable moments with loved ones amidst the realities of visa restrictions and the Naira’s volatility against the Dollar.</p>



<p>“The dream of international travel, once a staple of Nigerian middle-class leisure, has faced a stark reality check. Yet, this has not dampened the spirit of exploration and relaxation among Nigerians, instead, it has redirected it, creating a burgeoning market for recreational real estate within the nation’s own vibrant landscapes. By tapping into the country’s own capacity, Nigeria is crafting its blueprint for a tourism renaissance. These establishments are not just leisure spots but symbols of Nigeria’s evolving tourism landscape. They represent the potential of domestic tourism to offer luxurious experiences domestically, contributing significantly to the country’s economic and tourism development.</p>



<p>“As Nigeria continues on this path, it does not simply adapt; it innovates. The nation is proving that adventure and relaxation are within reach. This movement isn’t just about leisure; it’s a robust engine for job creation. From construction to hospitality, the ripple effect of this domestic tourism surge is palpable. Every water slide constructed, every resort room booked, and every event held signals a beacon of employment and entrepreneurial opportunities.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>On the economic implication, the duo founders noted that the economic implications are vast. “Local tourism fosters local spending, which cycles back into the nation’s coffers, fostering a sense of self-reliance and economic resilience. Developments in recreational real estate often result in infrastructure enhancements – improved roads, enhanced utilities, and the proliferation of transportation services are but a few of the ancillary benefits that accompany these projects.</p>



<p>“Beyond the horizon, foreign investors are taking notice. Nigeria’s commitment to fostering an environment of affordable escapism is a clarion call to those looking to invest in a market ripe with potential and eagerness for growth. With this, Nigeria is not just navigating through economic challenges; it’s redefining leisure, championing a new era of tourism, and affirming that the finest escapades might just be a heartbeat away from home.”</p>

<p>Lagos, Nigeria, has a tropical savanna climate, characterized by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. The best time to visit a waterpark in Lagos would typically be during the dry season when the weather is sunny and rainfall is minimal. The dry season in Lagos generally extends from November to March.</p>



<p>During this period, you can expect warm temperatures and lower chances of rain, making it ideal for outdoor water activities. The waterpark experience is more enjoyable when the weather is clear, allowing you to fully enjoy the slides, pools, and other attractions without being interrupted by rain showers.</p>



<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that weather patterns can vary from year to year, and there may still be occasional rain showers during the dry season. It&#8217;s always a good idea to check the weather forecast before planning your visit to ensure optimal conditions for your waterpark adventure.</p>



<p>During the rainy season, which typically spans from April to October, Lagos experiences higher rainfall and increased humidity. This season may not be the best time to visit a waterpark as heavy rains can disrupt outdoor activities and limit the enjoyment of the park&#8217;s attractions.</p>



<p>Ultimately, to have the best experience at a waterpark in Lagos, it&#8217;s advisable to plan your visit during the dry season when the weather is more predictable and conducive to outdoor water activities. However, remember that kids go on long vacation from June to August, so checking your weather app even during the rainy season can help you plan a visit our water park. </p>

<p>Water parks are a lot of fun and a great way for families to spend time outside. But&nbsp;injuries like cuts, scrapes, and concussions can happen. When visiting a water park, it&#8217;s important to prioritize safety to ensure a fun and accident-free experience. Here are some safety tips to keep in mind:</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-layout-2 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">

</figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Observe height and weight restrictions: </strong>It is important to follow the rules in the waterpark including the height and weight restrictions for various rides and attractions. </p>



<p>Without height and weight restrictions, there&#8217;s a risk that people who are too small or large for a ride may fall out, break bones or get stuck. This can result in serious injuries or even death. These restrictions are in place for your safety. Otherwise, there is always a risk of tragedy. </p>

</figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Stay hydrated: </strong>You would think with all the water around, remembering to drink plenty of H<sub>2</sub>0 would be easy. However, being out in the sun and playing in the water can dehydrate you and the kids faster than you’d think. </p>



<p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day to prevent dehydration, especially when spending time under the sun.</p>
</div>
</div>

</figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Use sunscreen:</strong> Damage fro sun can still occuer even if you do not get sunburned, so it is important to apply and then reapply sunscreen during your time at the park or pool.</p>



<p>Apply sunscreen generously and frequently to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Reapply after water activities. </p>



<p>Even “waterproof” sunscreen isn’t actually waterproof – it will wear off after 90 minutes or so.&nbsp; This makes reapplying as important as the first coat of sunscreen.</p>



<p>Make sure you use sunscreen on any body part that isn’t covered by clothing, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tops of feet and hands</li>



<li>Ears (even if your child has long hair)</li>



<li>Scalp (if your child has thin hair, or parts their hair a certain way)</li>



<li>Sunscreen needs to soak into the skin before it’s fully effective.  Make sure to apply the first coat before you leave the house so you’ll be protected as soon as you get to the water park.</li>



<li>Lips. You can buy lip balm with sunscreen in it to properly cover your mouth</li>
</ul>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Dress appropriately:</strong> To ensure one&#8217;s comfort and safety while enjoying activities at the water park, it is essential to wear appropriate attire. Swimwear is of course paramount; opt for something lightweight and breathable such as spandex or nylon blends. </p>



<p>Wear proper swimwear that fits well and is suitable for water activities.  You can shop for appropriate clothes at our <a href="http://giwagardens.com/add-ons/">accessories shop</a>. Finally, avoid loose clothing or accessories that may get tangled in rides.</p>

</figure>
</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Keep an eye on children:</strong> Water parks have various attractions such as pools, slides, wave pools, and lazy rivers, which can pose potential risks for children. By keeping a close watch on them, you can ensure they stay within safe areas and follow the rules.</p>



<p>If they are not strong swimmers, ensure they wear appropriate floatation devices. Remember, even if there are lifeguards present at the water park, their primary responsibility is the overall safety of all visitors. It&#8217;s still essential for parents, guardians, or responsible adults to actively supervise children to provide an additional layer of protection and ensure a safe and enjoyable experience at the water park.</p>



<p>Keeping an eye on children also helps ensure they do not get separated from the group or wander off into potentially dangerous areas. It also aids in quickly locating them in case of an emergency.</p>



<p>Spending time at a water park can be physically demanding, and children may not always be aware of their hydration needs. By supervising them, you can remind them to drink water regularly and apply sunscreen to protect their skin from sunburn.</p>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Be cautious on water slides:</strong> Pay close attention to any posted signs, rules, or instructions provided by the water park staff regarding the proper use of the water slide. Listen carefully to any safety briefings or guidelines before going on the slide and follow them accordingly. </p>



<p>Position yourself properly on the slide. Sit or lay down on your back or follow the designated riding position advised by the slide&#8217;s guidelines. Avoid standing or sliding headfirst, as it can increase the risk of accidents or injuries.</p>



<p>Be aware of other sliders and respect their space. Don&#8217;t engage in dangerous or disruptive behavior that may endanger yourself or others.</p>



<p>While it can be thrilling to slide quickly, try to control your speed by keeping your arms and legs close to your body. Avoid using excessive force or pushing off the sides, as it can lead to loss of control.</p>

</div>



<div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Know the location of first aid stations:</strong> Reputable water park builders will always advise owners to have numerous first-aid stations throughout their parks so that they are accessible.</p>



<p>Familiarize yourself with the location of first aid stations or medical facilities in case of emergencies. At<a href="http://giwagardens.com/"> Giwa Gardens</a>, our First aid locations are easily located at the entrance to the water park and  are easily accessible</p>

<p><strong>Weather:</strong> Lagos has a tropical climate, so it&#8217;s usually hot and humid, which is a good weather to hit the waters. Check the weather forecast before heading to the waterpark to ensure it&#8217;s a good day for outdoor activities.</p>



<p><strong>Operating Hours:</strong> Waterparks in Lagos typically have specific operating hours. Find out the opening and closing times of the park you plan to visit to make the most of your day.</p>



<p><strong>Entrance Fees:</strong> Waterparks usually have entrance fees or tickets. Check the pricing details in advance so you can plan your budget accordingly.</p>



<p><strong>Facilities: </strong>Waterparks offer various facilities and attractions such as water slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and children&#8217;s play areas. Familiarize yourself with the available amenities and attractions to plan your activities accordingly.</p>



<p><strong>Dress Code:</strong> Most waterparks have specific dress codes for safety reasons. It&#8217;s common for waterparks to require visitors to wear appropriate swimwear and not allow street clothes or jeans in the water. Check the dress code guidelines to ensure you comply with the rules.</p>



<p><strong>Safety Precautions:</strong> Follow all safety instructions and rules provided by the waterpark. Pay attention to lifeguards and signage. Stay hydrated, use sunscreen, and take breaks as needed to avoid heat-related issues.</p>



<p><strong>Food and Refreshments:</strong> Many waterparks have on-site food and beverage options. However, you may also be allowed to bring your own food and drinks. Check the park&#8217;s policy regarding outside food and beverages to plan accordingly.</p>



<p><strong>Locker Rentals:</strong> Consider renting a locker to secure your belongings while enjoying the water attractions. This way, you won&#8217;t have to worry about losing or damaging your valuables.</p>
